# Email-Breach-Checker
Just a complex script in python3.7 to check if an email has been pwned and if there are any cleartext password online.

## Installation
You'll need:
- Python 3.x
- Requests 
- Selenium
- [Cloudflare Scraper](https://github.com/Anorov/cloudflare-scrape)
- Termcolor
- BeatifulSoup
- Geckodriver

Just start up `pip3 install -r requirements` and you are ready to go!

## Usage
It's really easy:
`python3 ebc.py admin@example.org` and it's all automated!

### Note
To see possible cleartext password, you'll need a **VIP** account on [GhostProject](http://ghostproject.fr)

### P.S.
Please, note that this script/tool has written fastly and badly. Have some mercy for me :P
